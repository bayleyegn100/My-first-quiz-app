# My-first-quiz-app
## Project Title: Developing a quiz app for multiple-choice questions.
## Motivation
For the use of different purposes on-line quizzes and surveys are increasing. In some cases, it is not easy to filter out the number of applicants for a limited number of vacancies. In addition, to come up with a conclusion you have to collect some data, and based on the analysis derived from the data generated the use of quiz apps are very useful and 
efficient with some limitations.

## Actions taken to address the problem
To develop this app as a junior and startup I started by internalizing the issue and scatch it into a paper. Following that, I figuredf our the sources that I should have to look and go through to enrich the code and the process of developing the app. I started the coding work by writing the HTML part first. Next to writing the code, I started to style the HTML by using CSS and bootstrap links. The final coding is done with is the javascript file. In the process, I had been opening the browser to check whether the coding is working or not. Finally, I developed this app. 

## Lesson Learned
I had been struggling the get the tail of the app. It was not easy. Although developing this app sometimes got lost, confused, and sometimes get crazy I love it. Because through the process I learn a lot of stuff and feel better.
